User stories:
IN PROGRESS - (10 points): As a player, I want the option of a single player (human vs AI) or a multiplayer (human vs human) game. 
IN PROGRESS - (10 points): As a developer, I want to store all of the gesture options/choices in a List<T>. I want to make use of this List somewhere within my code/application.
IN PROGRESS - (5 points): As a developer, I want to account for and handle bad user input, ensuring that any user input is validated and reobtained if necessary.* 
-need to 'reobtain'
-maybe overload getuserinput to optionally take a third string VARIABLE (value? reference?) to get the actual user input back?

(10 points): As a player, I want the correct player to win a given round based on the choices* made by each player.
